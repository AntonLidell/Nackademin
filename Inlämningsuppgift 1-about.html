            <h3>Origin story</h3>
            <p4>
                    It’s our first time together, me and my two best friend Susan and Annabelle visiting Tokyo. We came from a small farming community in Japan and we’re so excited for our adventure in the big city. It didn’t happen so often because it’s far away from where we are. <br/>

                    Since the three of us are all first timers, we feel like a little kid exploring everything. All went well until we decided to use the public restroom. On that time, all the instructions are all written in Japanese and we don’t know how to read it.<br/>
                    
                    Then all of a sudden, I hear a commotion and see a guard coming towards the women’s restroom shouting “dareda” (誰だ) means “who” and “dare desuka?”(誰ですか?) means “who is it”. Then Annabelle came rushing to us (Susan and me) to go out of there as fast as we could. <br/>
                    We found out that she push the red button which is intended for emergency purposes. She thought it’s the button for flushing the toilet ba ha …Naturally, the male guard came rushing to the toilet full of women and nobody knows who push the emergency button. <br/>
                    We had a good laugh but it serves also as a lesson. By being ignorant and lazy to learn the language could get us into a lot of trouble. From then on, we make an effort to learn to read, write and speak the language. We found out the best way to learn the language easily is through singing in a karaoke establishment.<br/>
